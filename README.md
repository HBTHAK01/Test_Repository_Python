This is a demo test repository in Python on GitHub by Het Thakkar. The aim of this code is to help the snail reach the top of the well (X cm away from the top of the well) from the bottom (at 0 position). The movement of snail is such that in a minute snail can climb up 2, 3, 4, or 5 cm, and in that same minute it climbs down 1, 2, or 3 cm.
